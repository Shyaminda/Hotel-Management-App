//here the AppContext is globally available to all the components in the app
//The context object, created through React.createContext, facilitates the sharing of data or functions between different parts of the component tree. 
//It allows components to access these shared values without needing to pass props explicitly through intermediate components. 
//This is particularly useful for global data like themes, user authentication, language preferences, etc., which many components across the application might need access to.
//It helps in managing the state or providing global data without the need for prop drilling (passing props through multiple layers of components), improving code maintainability and reducing code complexity.
